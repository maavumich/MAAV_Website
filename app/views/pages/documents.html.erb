	  <p>Members of software work in groups to tackle computer vision and localization challenges, and develop a strategy to complete our mission in the IARC.
		  To do this, we work closely with graduate students and leverage advanced algorithms.
		  The most challenging component of our competition is computer vision based localization.
		  We detect lines and ground robots using input from five on-board RGBD cameras using our customized detection algorithms.
		  The results are passed onto a highly sophisticated model that fuses input from the on-board inertial measurement unit (IMU) and computer vision results to predict the location of our vehicle in real time.
		  We also benchmark various state-of-the-art object tracking algorithms and adapt the one best suited for our mission.
		  Finally, we execute a mission strategy using knowledge of our current state of the vehicle and ground robots inside the competition arena.</p>

	  <h2 class="display-4">The Infrastructure of Intelligent Flight</h2>
	  <p>The Software Infrastructure team writes the software that coordinates the execution of navigation software, simulates the competition, and communicates with the physical hardware. We allow various navigation software components to communicate with each other. In addition, we write software which provides a publish/subscribe interface to the physical hardware, allowing navigation software components to subscribe to sensor updates or publish control input. To simulate the competition, we can swap out the hardware interface software with simulator software that exposes the same interface to the navigation software components, but instead of talking to hardware, talks to a simulated quadcopter in a simulated field. The Software Infrastructure team writes both embedded, bare metal software running on an ARM microcontroller, low level Linux Software, and Linux applications.</p>

	  <p>Software is one of MAAV's largest growing subteams. With added focus on a onboarding and training.
		  Software has restructured into one of the most productive groups on MAAV. Building the brain of the drone is hard work and we are always
	  looking for hard working students interested in learning more about the world of intelligent robotics  </p>
